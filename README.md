# Blackjack-Game
#blackjack, also called twenty-one and pontoon, gambling card game popular in casinos throughout the world.
#Players hope to get a total card value of 21 or to come closer to it, without going over, than the dealer, against whom all betting is done. For this purpose aces count as 1 or 11, face cards as 10, and the rest at their index value. A hand counting 21 on the first two cards (an ace and a 10 or face card) is called a natural or a blackjack.
